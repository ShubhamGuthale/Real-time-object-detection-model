# Real time object detection model

- This is a Object Detection Web App build by using Custom trained models, Streamlit Framework and PyTorch like Google Lens.
- In this project, I trained a custom dataset model that support more than 50+ objects.
-  It is a Object Detection Web App build by using Machine Learning, Image Processing and labelImg (Graphical image annotation tool), Jupyter notebook and Custom trained models.


# Object Detection Web App 
  In this project I am building real time object detection 
model. It detect the object in real time. In this project we trained 20 different object those are :- 
- Person
- Car
- Chair
- Pottedplant
- Bird
- Dog
- Sofa
- bicycle
- Horse
- Boat
- Motorbike
- Cat
- Tv Monitor
- Cow
- Sheep
- Aeroplane
- Train
- Diningtable
- Bus



## Technology 
- Python 3.12.4
- Streamlit Framework
- PyTorch
- Jupyter notebook 
- labelImg (Graphical image annotation tool)
- numpy,pandas,opencv-python


## Here are some snapshots.
